# AudioHarbor
A Youtube Audio Downloader made with PyTube! The main idea is to download the audio files from a selected playlist by selecting the playlist URL. Further features like importing lists from Spotify will be the next goal once the main idea is completed.

# Version 1.0
A quick version of the idea: you can pick a playlist, paste the URL to the program and it will download the playlist to a selected location.
