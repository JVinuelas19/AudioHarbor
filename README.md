# AudioHarbor
An audio downloader made with PyTube and Spotify API! The main idea is to download the audio files from YT or Spotify. Next steps will be creating a cool GUI to simplify its use

# Version 1.0
A quick version of the idea: you can pick a playlist, paste the URL to the program and it will download the playlist to a selected location.

# Version 1.1
A lot of features added and bug fixes:
- Main menu 
- Download YT songs
- Show YT channel information
- Import playlists from Spotify accounts via Spotify API (Spotify parser)
- Configuration menu: you can request Spotify tokens and select the store location of the songs downloaded by the app
- Commented code

You need Spotify API credentials if you want to use the Spotify function. You can request it here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
There are some bugs with the pytube version 15.0.0 that requires updating a couple of pytubes .py files. I will add to the repository the fixed .py files (these fixes are not mine, they are on the pytube issues page. I'm just providing them to make your life easier).
This code has educational purposes only.
